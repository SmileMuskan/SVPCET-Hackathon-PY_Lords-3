> Problem Statement No 3 :
Build an app or online platform which programming students can 
use to capture their work-based experiences and share these 
learning experiences with other students through text, photos or
videos.
The focus should be to develop a platform that allows programming 
students to share their work experiences and projects with other younger 
students.

> Solution : 
We have developed a website that can be used by programming students for
sharing their work through the text, photos, and videos. This platform will
allow young programmers to interact with experienced programmers and take
help in their ongoing projects.

> Project Description :
Our website is a platform for programmers to share their work experiences.
When a programmer or visiter shares his work on your website it's accessed by
other programmers and they can discuss problems faced by the programmer.
This will make it easy for new programmers to learn.
